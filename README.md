## Aggregate.ipynb

## Modeling.ipynb

This is the meat and bones of our project as it contains: 
- Logistic Regression attempts
- Random Forest Classifier attempts
- XGBoost Attempts
- SHAP Graphs
- Models saved as pkl files - 
## EDA Folder
This folder contains a lot of our EDA, exploring a lot of avenues, although not all of them turned out to be fruitful. The most important figures from our presentation are contained in the "More_EDA.ipynb" file.
