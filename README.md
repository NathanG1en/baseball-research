# Analyzing Pitch Characteristics in Critical Two-Strike Scenarios for Right-Handed Pitchers
By: Nathan Glen, Esmeralda Hechavarria, Yasmine Juarez, Andy Millian 

## Aggregate.ipynb 
This file contains our consolidation of the data from all three years into one file 

## Modeling.ipynb

This is the meat and bones of our project as it contains: 
- Logistic Regression attempts
- Random Forest Classifier attempts
- XGBoost Attempts
- SHAP Graphs
- Models saved as pkl files 

## SHAP_Graphs.py
This contains our Streamlit application:
- We read in a model
- Then we generate all the summary plots for each pitcher
- Finally, we generate all the waterfall plots for each individual pitch <br/> 
We used streamlit to let us interact with all of these plots in a user-friendly manner. 
## EDA Folder
This folder contains a lot of our EDA, exploring a lot of avenues, although not all of them turned out to be fruitful. The most important figures from our presentation are contained in the "More_EDA.ipynb" file. 

## Not_Used_in_Final Folder
This folder is exactly what is looks like.
